                    Ah, New York in the Fall. The leaves changing, the brisk air, sweater weather!</p>
                <p class="copy">And ramen season.</p>
                <p class="copy">That's right - ramen. While everyone stands in line for PSLs and plans their Friendsgiving menu, you will be cozying up to a big bowl of hot broth and noodles.</p>
                <p class="copy">Read on for my top five ramen shops in the East Village.

                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>1. Cocoron</b></span>
                    <p class="copy"><i>16 Delancey Street</i></p>
                    <p class="copy"> Cocoron's menu is long for a ramen shop, but this is becuase they serve three types of ramen. First is the traditional soba in broth style. Second is dip soba - broth with cold soba noodles on the side that you dip into the broth. Why would you want noodles not in the broth? Soba gets soggy if it sits too long, and maybe you're more of a broth sipper than a noodle slurper. I don't know your life. And finally cold soba (if you're into that).
                    </p>
                    <p class="copy">
                        The Warm Mera Mera Soba is their specialty, and with good reason. Hot soba in a broth with minced chicken and veggies. The sesame chili oil gives the broth a kick.
                    </p>
                    <p class="copy">
                        A second crowd pleaser is the Warm Sansai Soba. If you're feeling under the weather, this is the soba for you. Loaded with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and deep fried tofu, this is also a great pick for vegetarians.
                    </p>
                    <p class="copy">Cocoron is cash only!!</p>

            <div class="article-copy">
                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>2. Ivan Ramen</b></span>
                    <p class="copy"><i>25 Clinton Street</i></p>
                    <p class="copy">Ivan Ramen was started by Chef Ivan Orkin. Originally from Long Island, he has spent extensive time in Japan, so he gets to do that "I know all the rules and now I'm going to break them," like ee cummings. His Jewish upbringing is reflected in his ramen. Every day he makes vats of homemade, salty chicken stock for the broth base, and uses rye flour for his noodles instead of traditional buckwheat. This makes for good broth, and a different noodle texture.</p>
                    <p class="copy">The Clinton Street location can fill up, so be sure to book a reservation (and then walk just up the street to Cocoa Bar for a chocolate cocktail desert!). Or try his outpost in Gotham Market in Hell's Kitchen. Not the LES atmosphere, but it's also not the LES wait.</p>

            <div class="article-copy">
                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>3. Niche</b></span>
                    <p class="copy"><i>172 Delancey Street</i></p>
                    <p class="copy">If we're being exact, Niche is actually known for its mazeman - brothless ramen. Think Japanese spaghetti. Really, really tasty Japanese spaghetti.</p>
                    <p class="copy">What Chef Shigetoshi Nakamura doesn't provide in broth, he makes up for in delicious toppings. The go to is the steak mazeman. Another favorite is the Creme de Bacon, a twist on spaghetti carbonara.</p>
                    <p class="copy">This place also fills up fast, so a reservation is ideal. If too crowded, you could try Imperial Chinese just next door.</p>

            <div class="article-copy">
                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>4. Momofuku Noodle Bar</b></span></p>
                <p class="copy"><i>171 1st Ave</i></p>
                <p class="copy">One of the OG kitchens of David Chang. Chang's ramen is smoky, with barley noodles, which are a bit heartier, and most come with a beautiful hard boiled egg.</p>
                <p class="copy">Noodle Bar does not take traditional reservations, but they do take online reservations for their fried chicken meals. If you have a group of 6 or more and have something fun to celebrate - fried chicken might be the way to go.</p>
                <p class="copy">For us introverts, try visiting on your own! While there might be a two hour wait for a couple on date night, there is usually one stool open at the bar. Fingers crossed you get to sit in front of the noodle sation.</p>

            <div class="article-copy">
                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>5. Ippudo</b></span></p>
                <p class="copy"><i>65 4th Ave</i></p>
                <p class="copy">If you are looking for spicy ramen, Ippudo is the place. The Karaka Spicy ramen will clear your sinuses if you feel a cold coming on. You also might need to order kaedama - extra noodles- as Ippudo has a bit higher broth-to-noodles ratio.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-copy">
                <p class="copy" style="margin: 0;"><span><b>Honorable Mention: Han Dynasty</b></span></p>
                <p class="copy"><i>90 3rd Ave</i></p>
                <p class="copy">No Han Dynasty is not a ramen shop, but I have three words for you: Dan. Dan. Noodles. Perfeclty chewy, with spicy chili-oil hit with minced pork. These are great with a cold beer, or as an appetizer to split before the ginger chicken.</p>
